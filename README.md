# SQL-Q

This is the github repository that I maintained while learning SQL.

Here, I have taken note of various SQL concepts and commands.


I have used MySQL as a database in this tutorial but the commands specified here are almost similar to all variant of SQL. 


You can run this command and tinker around with them in your local machine, just make sure you have created a database and the associated tables.


You can find SQL command for creating database and table for this tutorial in `SQL-commands` folder.


Thank you
